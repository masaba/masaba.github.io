I'm a developmental and learning scientist. I lead [Tangle & Thrive](https://www.teachinglabstudio.com/blog/introducing-tangle-thrive), a project within Teaching Lab Studio focused on designing and testing ways that generative AI can meaningfully support student engagement, motivation, and learning. 

I come from a background in cognitive science, where I studied how the building blocks of children's social cognition, such as their perspective-taking and inferential abilities, shape how they learn about themselves, others, and the world around them. My current work extends this foundation into applied behavioral science: How can we design activities, tools, and environments that help students engage more fully in school and respond to how they think, feel, and grow?

My research toolkit leverages behavioral experiments, surveys, computational methods, and design partnerships with teachers and students. I collaborate closely with educators and families to test solutions that are practical, equitable, and responsive to students' experiences.

I completed my PhD in Psychology at Stanford University and have received funding from the National Science Foundation to conduct independent doctoral and postdoctoral research.
