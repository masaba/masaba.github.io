Hello there! I'm Mika. I am a developmental cognitive scientist studying how children build self-representations through their social interactions, and the consequences of these processes on their behaviors and motivation. Basically, I want to know how children answer: Who am I, and who do you think I am?

I'm a NSF-funded postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Psychology at Yale University working with [Julia Leonard](https://jlnrd.github.io/) and [Julian Jara-Ettinger](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/). I received my Ph.D in August 2021 in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, where I primarily worked with [Hyowon Gweon](https://web.stanford.edu/~hyo/Home.html). Many years ago, I received my BA in [Neuroscience](https://www.wellesley.edu/neuroscience) from Wellesley College.

You can reach me at: mika.asaba [at] yale.edu.
