Hello there! I'm Mika. I'm a developmental psychologist curious about how children learn about the social world. In particular, much of my research has focused on how children build representations of individuals (including themselves) and social groups (including their own). What I am most excited about is how these representations shape real-world behaviors and outcomes, e.g., in educational contexts.

I am currently an NSF-funded postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychology at Yale University working with [Julia Leonard](https://jlnrd.github.io/) and [Julian Jara-Ettinger](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/). I received my Ph.D in August 2021 in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University, where I primarily worked with [Hyowon Gweon](https://web.stanford.edu/~hyo/Home.html). Many years ago, I received my BA in [Neuroscience](https://www.wellesley.edu/neuroscience) from Wellesley College.
