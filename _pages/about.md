Hi there! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University.

In my research, I leverage a diverse range of methods––including surveys, behavioral studies, and computational modeling––to understand the psychological mechanisms that shape learning outcomes and motivation. To that end, my research primarily takes a developmental approach, focusing on early childhood through adolescence.

I completed my PhD in Psychology at Stanford University. I have received funding from the National Science Foundation to conduct independent doctoral and postdocoral research.
