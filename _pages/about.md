Hello! I'm Mika. I am a cognitive scientist studying how children learn and communicate about the self to others. 

I'm a Ph.D student in the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. I primarily work with [Dr. Hyowon Gweon](https://web.stanford.edu/~hyo/Home.html) in the [Social Learning Lab](http://sll.stanford.edu/). Starting in Fall 2021, I will be a postdoc working with [Dr. Julia Leonard](https://jlnrd.github.io/) and [Dr. Julian Jara-Ettinger](https://compdevlab.yale.edu/) in Yale's Department of Psychology.

I received my BA in [Neuroscience](https://www.wellesley.edu/neuroscience) from Wellesley College in 2014. During my undergraduate years, I was a research assistant in Dr. Rebecca Saxe's [Social Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://saxelab.mit.edu/), and Dr. Laura Schulz's [Early Childhood Cognition Lab](http://eccl.mit.edu/) at MIT.

You can reach me at: masaba [at] stanford.edu. And my name is pronounced like this: Mee-kuh Uh-saw-buh.
