I'm a developmental and learning scientist. I lead [Tangle & Thrive](https://www.teachinglabstudio.com/blog/introducing-tangle-thrive), a project within Teaching Lab Studio focused on designing and testing ways generative AI can meaningfully support student engagement, motivation, and learning.

My work integrates surveys, behavioral experiments, collaborative design partnerships with teachers and students, and computational methods to understand the psychological mechanisms that shape learning outcomes.

I come from a background in cognitive science, where I studied how the building blocks of children’s social cognition—such as their perspective-taking abilities—shape how they learn about themselves and relate to others. My current work extends this foundation into applied behavioral science: How can we design environments, tools, and interactions that genuinely shift students’ behavior and help them engage more in school?

I completed my PhD in Psychology at Stanford University and have received funding from the National Science Foundation to conduct independent doctoral and postdoctoral research.
